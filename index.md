## Welcome to Strelok's Github Page

This page will likely be neglected for at least a little while as there are a lot of things going on right now in my life.

For the moment I have decided to scrap the old 2D graphics project as don't even remember what I was doing.
I was looking at C++ tutorials but not actually programming anything, so I was effectively wasting my time.

As of 19/06/2022 I will be working on a brand new 2D graphics project which I hope to develop into its own game engine to create a fan game.
I expect lots of bumps along the road with all the things going on in my life right now but hopefully I'll have something fucntioning by the end of the year.

I will be using learnOpenGL as my current reference while developing the project and occasionally looking at learnCPP to figure out any hiccups my project has that aren't involving OpenGL.

Stay tuned for more, Strelok out.
